Search Live supplies integrated live search facilities and advanced search features.

== Description ==

*Search Live* supplies effective integrated live search facilities and advanced search features.
It provides a smooth interactive experience with immediate results for your site's visitors,
making it easier and more efficient to find the right results.

It provides instant **live search results** with thumbnails where matches are found for one or multiple search keywords in titles, excerpts or content,
allows to enhance the standard search form with this functionality,
provides a flexible shortcode `[search_live]` that can be placed anywhere
to provide an interactive search form and a widget for use in sidebars.
The shortcode and widget can be fine-tuned with sensible options to improve the search experience for your visitors.

- Instant search results replace the standard WordPress search form. This is enabled by default but you can turn it off.
- You can use the **shortcode** `[search_live]` to place a search form anywhere.
- You can use the *Search Live* **widget** in your sidebars.
- Supports Custom Post Types.
- Full multilanguage support and [WPML compatible](https://wpml.org/plugin/search-live/).

*Search Live* can show instant search results including thumbnails and short descriptions or manual excerpts.
Among other useful options, you can determine the number of results shown and whether to search in any combination
of titles, excerpts or contents. These can be determined individually for each instance of *Search Live's* shortcode
or widget.

*Search Live* supplies results from posts, pages and other public post types.
*Search Live* fully supports multilanguage sites with [WPML](https://wpml.org).
We're working on an extended version that provides enhanced features and support for taxonomies.
